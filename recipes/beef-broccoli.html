        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <h3>TO MAKE THE BEEF AND BROCCOLI:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add the steak to a large bowl, along with the soy sauce and rice wine vinegar.  Stir to combine, then let the steak marinate for at least 10 minutes (or up to 1 hour).</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, fill a large stockpot halfway full of water, and bring it to a boil.  Stir the broccoli florets into the water, and cook for 30-45 seconds.  Drain (or transfer the broccoli to a strainer), and set aside.</li>
                        <li>Prepare the sauce (see instructions below).</li>
                        <li>Once the steak has finished marinating, add the peanut oil to a large saute pan or wok over medium-high heat.  Add the steak and garlic, and saute — stirring occasionally — until the steak is cooked through, about 5-6 minutes.  Add the sauce and broccoli, and toss to combine.  Continue cooking for 1-2 more minutes, or until the sauce comes to a simmer and thickens.</li>
                        <li>Remove from heat and serve immediately, topped with optional garnishes if desired.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h3>TO MAKE THE SAUCE:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Whisk all ingredients together until combined.</li>
                    </ol>
